<h1>A1: Scene Viewer
<span class="subtitle">by <span class="placeholder">Yunqi Li (yunqili)</span></span>
</h1>

<p class="placeholder">
Summarize:
<br>
I made a scene.h file to contain the definition of all scene elements in the JSON file.
<br> I wrote some math code for math calculations. 
<br>I created a mesh reader to read .b72 format.
<br>I made several camera interactions.
<br>
The node transformation seems have some problem but I didn't managed to find that. Also I didn't managed to finish animation, hide, culling, compiling by maekfile due to time limitation. 
(I have a poor foundation in computer science and programming and this is the first time for me to write such a large structure of code)
</p>

<h2>My Animation <span class="atag creative">A1-create</span></h2>

<p class="placeholder">
Describe your animation and include a screen recording showing it running in real-time:
NO
</p>

<video>
</video>

<p class="placeholder">
Describe how you created your animation. NONE
</p>

<h2>Using the Scene Viewer</h2>

<p class="placeholder">
    To use the scene viewer, change the json file path in "JsonParser jsonParser(JSON file path)" in the main function in main.cpp. Then run the app.
	<br>
	<br>
    The default camera is userCamera, which has the camera interactions.
	<br><br>
    Pressing number 1 on the keyborad will change the camera to user camera, pressing 2 will change to the first scene camera, 
    and pressing 3 will change to debug camera(but it's same as the user camera because I didn't finish culling). 
	<br>Keeping pressing 2 will traverse all scene cameras and the camera name would be shown in the terminal.
</p>

<h3>Command-line Arguments NONE</h3>

<p class="placeholder">
No command-line arguments are implemented
(I used Visual Studio to compile during coding)
</p>

<h3>Controls</h3>

<p class="placeholder">
Document the keyboard and mouse controls used to control your viewer when run interactively.
Note that the controls below are placeholders not requirements.
</p>

<ul>
<li class="placeholder"><kbd>1</kbd> switch to the user camera.</li>
<li class="placeholder"><kbd>2</kbd> switch to/traverse the scene camera.</li>

<li class="placeholder">mouse middle button pressed and drag: rotate the camera</li>
<li class="placeholder">mouse middle button scroll: zoom in/out the scene</li>
</ul>


<h2>My Code</h2>

<p class="placeholder">
For each of the following sections, describe the overall structure of your code, and reference the specific files/functions/data structures that you used.
For any parts that are incomplete, discuss what you were able to do and what you tried but couldn't get working.
</p>

<p class="placeholder">
The purpose of this section is to get you to think critically about your code by explaining it to course staff; these thoughts may help you improve the code as you work on it in A2 and beyond.
This section also forms a road map to your code that we can use while grading.
</p>

<h3>Support Code for Math and Vulkan</h3>

<p class="placeholder">
I implemented vec3, vec4 and mat4 classes. I just implemented several operations that I need to use in the scene rendering so it's definitely not comprehensive. 
<br>
<br>
For the vec3 / vec4, I implemented =, +, -, * operators, basic functions like length(), normalize(), dot product, cross product, and min/max.
<br>
<br>
For mat4.h, I implemented translate, rotation and scale matrix construction, and impelemented lookAt, perspective matrix construction in reference of glm lookAt and perspective algorithm.
I also implemented *(mat4, vec3, vec4), *=, inverse(), and transpose() function for mat4.
<br>
<br>
For the vulkan support, I basically used the set up code in vulkan tutorial.
</p>

<h3>Loading scenes, Mesh data <span class="atag">A1-load</span></h3> 

<p class="placeholder">
For the JSON parser, I wrote it just for .s72 file format. All parsed data were stored in the vectors or maps (like jsonParser.meshes)
of the JSONparser instance. For detailed coding, I just use a filestream to read the file. After detecting a object of the scene graph, I would
create a new stringstream to get that line, use getline to get the value using different charactor as allocator (':' & ',').
For the meshes, cameras and nodes, I used std::map to store them because they have a unique index that would be used to assign attributes. For the others, I
just used vectors.
<br>
<br>
The meshReader.h accept a mesh element and read the .b72 file to vertices structure to put into the mesh data. For the basic implementation, it's just a simple basic binary reader.
To add the vertices information of each data, I just used a loop to traverse jsonParser.meshes (where the mesh data is stored) and for each mesh I used the meshReader to put the vertices data.
For the render, I first parse the 
JSON data, then use mesh reader to read vertices. After that, I set up the nodes' parent relationships, and compute transformation matrix for each node.
The nodes are traversed to instance corresponding mesh or camerma and the transformation matrixes are applied to them as well. I didn't managed to change to push constants and still remain
at the Uniform Buffer method. I pushed all vertices data to a large vector to create vertex buffer.
</p>
<h3>Drawing the scene. <span class="atag">A1-show</span></h3>

<p class="placeholder">
Cover, at least:
how your code computes camera transformations;
how your code get transformation and vertex data to your shaders.
</p>
<p class="placeholder">
Include a screenshot of your viewer drawing an example scene.
<br>
<br>
For the nodes transformations, I first build the nodes' parent/children relationship for each node, than I compute the overall transformation matrix for each node based on the recursive operation
(multiply parent's transformation to this node).
<br>
<br>
After computing all nodes' local to world values, I applied the value to vertices and cameras.
For the vertices, I multipled the localToWorld transformation matrix to the vertex POSITION, and multipled the transposed inverted localToWorld matrix to vertex NORMAL.
For the scene cameras, to just apply translation to position, I extracted the first three items of the last column in matrix as translation direction, then apply it to position value of camera.
To just apply rotation value to the camera front, up and right directions, I multiplied the localToWorld matrix with a vec4 that the last element is 0.0f (indicating it's a vector), than use the normalized fisrt 3 value of the output as the result.
<br>
<br>
Problem: I found that the node transformation is wierd in the scene. I don't know why. In the rotation.s72, it normal because it didn't contain parent relationship. 
But for others the scene is wierd. I've been debugging it for a long time but stil couldn't find why.
</p>

<h3>Handling interactive camera and debug camera movement. <span class="atag">A1-show</span></h3>

<p class="placeholder">
I implemented camera controls including rotation, 4-direction translation(up, down, right, left), zooming in/out/ 
The camera controls are implemented both in camera class (in scene.h) and main.cpp (to get glfw key/mouse event and callbacks).

<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p class="placeholder">
The workload is too heavy for me. I'm not a computer science department student when I was in my bachelor's degree. The reason I select this class is I want to be a technical artist 
(instead of graphics engineer) as my carer goal, so it would be good for me to understand some real-time rendering math / theories that could be implemented into game engines like unreal or unity.
<br><br>
For me, I have poor foundation with computer science and coding, it would be too hard for me to implement all the functions / structures of a render software by myself without using other external libraries.
For example, it's my first time to have access to JSON parser, so I need to search on the internet and learn it for a long time to start coding. This is the same when I tried to understand the Maekfile compile, and command line controlling (but I failed to implement them).
For me, I'm more eager to focus on the algorithm / math / theory / function part of real-time rendering (shadow / light / real-time path-tracing) but not from the base of a structure. (I'm sorry for this!)
<br><br>
Also, as an ETC student, I have a project course which is 36 hours per week. I need to put a lot of time into the project, and don't have enough time to implement the code in this course. 
It's obvious that I didn't finish a lot of parts in this assignment though I think I've spent too much time on this. I'm really afraid if I would fail this course.
<br><br>
Last, it would be much better if the class have more TAs to answering questions like 15462 computer graphics course.(Or a way to privately ask questions like Piazza)
